# The Dev Workflow

## Important Mindset

### The Growth Mindset

Potential Skill --> Realized Skill

1. You must practice to turn your potential skill into realized skill
2. With practice, your small potential skill can become a great realized skill

### The Design Mindset

#### Convergence

* What you want to accomplish
* What you'll create to make that happen
* Make stuff
* Reflect
* Repeat

#### Divergence

* Exploration
* Start small, get gradually bigger

* What over How

### Creative (Sticks & Carrots)

* Be nice to you

## Problem Solving

### Requirements

Set out the requirements for your problem


### Design

```java
function joinList(concepts) {
  if(concepts.length === 0) return "";
  return concepts.reduce(function(agg, concept) {
    return agg + ", " + concept;
    });
}

```

What over How

Creative (Sticks & Carrots)

Carrots and Sticks work the opposite of how you think they should. They produce a focusing effect that can blind you to important signals and possible ways to address problems.
As you're going, listen to your own motivations, and develop the ones that produce good results.
Problem Solving

Requirements

Join an array together in one comma-separated string.

joinList([]) -> ""
joinList(["one"]) -> "one"
joinList(["one", "two"]) -> "one, two"
Design

// (String[]) -> String
function joinList(strings){
  if(strings.length === 0){
    /* TODO: Return an empty string */
  } else if(strings.length === 1){
    /* TODO: Return the first string */
  } else {
    /* TODO: Return the strings comma-separated */
  }
}

console.log("joinList([])", joinList([]));
console.log("joinList(['one'])", joinList(['one']));
console.log("joinList(['one', 'two'])", joinList(['one', 'two']));
Implementation (and Experimentation)

Here, we implement our design, always focusing on what our code does, and running it as frequently as possible.

We may get to a spot where we reach the end of our abilities. At that point, we can use exploration to try a few things. Here, we create another file to test our techniques:

// iterating.wtf.js
var conceptList = ["gists", "types", "operators", "iteration", "problem solving"];

var output = "";

conceptList.forEach(function(value, index){
  output += value + "(" + index + ")";
});

console.log(output);
Debugging

function joinList(concepts){
  if(concepts.length === 0){
    /* Return an empty string */
    return "";
  } else if(concepts.length === 1){
    /* Return the first string */
    return concepts[0];
  } else {
    /* TODO: Return the strings comma-separated */
    var output = "";
    concepts.forEach(function(concept, index){
      output += concept + ", ";
    });
    return output;
  }
}

This version does most of what we want it to do, but it has some problems. In debugging, we answer two important questions:

What is happening?
What do we want to happen?
Refactoring

At this point, we clear up the code for readability and performance. WHATEVER CHANGE WE MAKE, WE MUST TEST TO SEE THAT IT STILL WORKS AS INTENDED!

function joinList(concepts){
  var output = "";
  concepts.forEach(function(concept, index){
    output += concept;
    if(index < concepts.length - 1){
      output += ", ";
    }
  });
  return output;
}
Theme & Variation

function joinList(concepts){
  var output = "";
  concepts.forEach(function(concept, index){
    output += ", ";
    output += concept;
  })
  return output.substr(2);
}
function joinList(concepts){
  if(concepts.length === 0) return "";

  if(concepts.length === 1) return concepts[0];

  return concepts[0] + ", " + joinList(concepts.slice(1));
}
function joinList(concepts){
  if(concepts.length === 0) return "";

  function iterate(subArray, agg){
    if(subArray.length === 0) return agg;
    return iterate(subArray.slice(1), agg + ", " + subArray[0]);
  }

  return iterate(concepts.slice(1), concepts[0]);
}
function joinList(concepts){
  if(concepts.length === 0) return "";
  return concepts.reduce(function(agg, concept){
    return agg + ", " + concept;
  });
}
