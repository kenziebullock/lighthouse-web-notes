# My notes:

* look into object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()
  - returns a boolean indicating wheher the object has the specified property.

## Creating a server

```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {

// () => {} = this is an inline anonomous callback function

  // console.log(request);
  response.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {

// 3000 = port to listen on
// '127.0.0.1' = ip address (loopback)

  console.log('READY');
});

```

### look into ejs alternatives such as jade or pug

Web Servers
When I hear the term 'Full Stack' I think of someone who can approach any layer of the technology stack in order to improve the value of the product. Today we focus on a crucial layer of the stack, Web Servers. We will start by building a web server using the Node HTTP library and then we can build the same type of server using the Express framework which is built on the Node HTTP library.

Project 2 - TinyApp
Over the next 4 days you will work on a project that uses the Express Framework to build a web server that handles requests from a client. This is a cullmination of everything you have learned so far.

Overview
What is a server?
Requests with Node
Express Framework
EJS Templates
Servers?
There are a few common patterns used for client/server communication. The one that is most common is called the Request-Response Model.

In the Request-Response Model a client sends a request to a server. The server then performs some computation and returns a response to the client.

Typically when we visualize servers we think of a rack of hardware with blinking lights and fans spinning. The reality is that without software those machines don't do much. Think of a server as an application on a machine that listens for a connection from a client.

There are a lot of different types of servers that you currently interact with. The performance of these servers is largely dependent on the hardware that they are running on.

Database Server
Game Server
Mail Server
Media Server
Print Server
Web Server
We can connect a machine to a network and run a server application on it, but there has to be a way for clients to find it. In 1981 the Internet Protocol (IP) specification was released. This document described the information necessary for finding a server as:

A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get there.

In the case of a web server the name would be something like http://www.lighthouselabs.ca. The address would be 104.25.75.20, and the route would be the machines/routers between you and the server.

Ports
You can run multiple applications on a machine. If we were to run a mail server and a web server on the same machine how would we know which server to hand the request to? We use ports. If a server wants to run on a port between 1 and 1023 then you will need superuser access. Any user can run a server on ports 1024 to 65535.

The reserved ports for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) are 80 for unsecure communication, and 443 for secure communication.

Applications
Apache, IIS (Microsoft) and nginx account for over 75% of the market share for all of the web servers on the internet.

When you you write an application that understands HTTP then you can configure one of these web servers to pass the requests that they receive to your application on a port you specify.

Today we will build an application using Node and we will run that application on port 3000.

Requests with Node
Node considers HTTP to be so important that their 'Hello World' example is an HTTP Server that responds with the string 'Hello World'.

const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;
We've imported the http module which allows us to create a server. When the server receives a request it calls the function we provide to it. The status code is set to 200 'OK', the header that indicates the type of the body is set to 'text/plain' and then we finish off the response by calling end() on the response object with the content 'Hello World\n'.

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.statusCode = 200;
  response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  response.end('Hello World\n');
});
If we were to run our application it would not run as expected. A server must listen for connections. We must tell our server to listen on a port.

server.listen(port, hostname, function() {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
Now when we run the application we see output in our console.

Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/

Please see the node.js file for the expanded server that was created during the lecture.

Express Framework
In order to be more efficient when handling requests we can use a Framework called Express. We can install the module with npm and then create a new express instance.

npm install --save express

var express = require('express');
var app = express();
All GET requests with the path '/' will be handled by a function that you define. In this case we send back the content 'Hello World\n' back to the client.

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
  response.send('Hello World!\n');
});
Just like the normal http example we have to tell our server when to start listening. We can specify the port, but by default Express handles the hostname for us.

app.listen(3000, function() {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
Now when we run the application we see output in our console.

Example app listening on port 3000!

Middleware
Express let's you use middleware to generalize behaviour for certain scenarios. If we want to serve static files (images, html, css, javascript) we can put them in a folder, and then tell Express that it should search there for any request and if it matches a path to a static file then return that. In this example we tell Express than any file in the public/ directory can be served as static.

app.use(express.static('public'));
With this configuration public/images/lighthouse-labs.png would be available at http://localhost:3000/images/lighthouse-labs.png.

Please see the express.js file for the expanded server that was created during the lecture.

EJS Templates
Embedded JS (EJS) is one of many templating libraries available for use in Express. EJS is a module so we need to install it with npm install --save ejs. In order to inform Express that we want to use EJS we set the value of view engine configuration to ejs.

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
By default EJS template files are found in a views/ directory. We can create a new index.ejs file and return it in a response with the render() method.

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
  response.render('index');
});
A basic ejs file could contain only HTML if you wanted.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Index</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Index</h1>
  </body>
</html>
EJS let's us embed JavaScript. We can use this to create dynamic pages. Let's say we wanted to display the User-Agent based on who makes the request. We need to send an object to the view engine that represents the variables we want to make available to our template. In this case we call it agent.

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
  response.render('index', {
    agent: request.headers['user-agent']
  });
});
We can then use that variable with the <%= %> syntax. The template system will read in the ejs file, find 'Embedded JavaScript' and evaluate it. When it is done the content is sent back to the client.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Index</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Using <%= agent %></h1>
  </body>
</html>
In the case that you want to only evaluate JavaScript and not print out the return value to the template you can use the tag <% %>. This would be more commonly used for looping or conditionals.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Index</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
    <% for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { %>
      <li><%= i %></li>
    <% } %>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
Please see the views/index.ejs and views/about.ejs files for the templates that were created during the lecture.

Bonus
If you are sick of restarting your Node Express server everytime you update your server.js file there is a tool available on npm called nodemon. Node Monitor will reload the server automatically when it detects changes to the JavaScript file that it is watching. I understand that nodemon doesn't work out of the box in vagrant and may need to be run with nodemon -L server.js. You'll have to look up with -L does, or not. Up to you.
